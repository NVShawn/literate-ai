# Active work

This file is the durable resumption queue for user-directed and discovered work. Before
implementation, follow `skills/agent/record-user-directed-work/SKILL.md`.
Keep detailed designs in focused roadmap documents and link them here.

## Detailed-roadmap lifecycle

This file is the sole resumable queue. Create a supporting file beneath `docs/roadmap/`
only when one item cannot keep a program's rationale, ordering, and acceptance contract
readable. Put this visible header immediately after the detailed document's title:

```markdown
- **Status:** active
- **Owning queue item:** [AREA-NNN](active-work.md#area-nnn-heading)
- **Completion / archival evidence:** pending while AREA-NNN remains open
```

Status is exactly `active`, `partial`, `deferred`, `completed`, or `historical`. The
owner must resolve to a checkbox or named program heading in this file. A terminal state
requires linked evidence. Keep a completed plan here only when doing so preserves useful
inbound links; move substantial closed programs beneath `docs/history/roadmap/`, retain
their owner, and mark them `historical`. Do not create a separate file for an ordinary
queue item or let `docs/roadmap/` become a plan archive.

## P0

### [ ] ONBOARD-001 — Replace this starter item with the first project outcome

- **Owner:** project core
- **Direction:** Record the user's desired outcome without copying conversation noise.
- **Conclusion:** State the evidence-backed implementation boundary.
- **Depends on:** none
- **Implementation:**
  - [ ] Name the next concrete change.
- **Evidence:**
  - [ ] Name the build, test, execution, or review proof required for completion.

Check the parent only after every required subtask and evidence item passes. Add the
release-visible outcome to `CHANGELOG.md`; Git preserves prior queue states.
