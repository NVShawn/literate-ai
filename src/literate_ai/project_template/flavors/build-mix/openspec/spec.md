# Mix build-system Flavor

### Requirement: Mix uses declarative dependency authority

Generated Elixir source MUST contain one `source/mix-project.json` using
`literate-ai/mix-project@1`. It MUST NOT contain `mix.exs`, `mix.lock`, or
`.iex.exs`. The authorized lifecycle SHALL synthesize the executable project
and derive its checksummed public Hex dependency lock outside admitted source.

#### Scenario: Build a locked Hex graph

- **WHEN** an Elixir Component selects the Mix build-system Flavor
- **THEN** the lifecycle resolves the inert dependency intent with its bound Hex plugin
- **AND** freezes the derived lock before compilation and records exact archive checksums
- **AND** runs native compilation with all output beneath the external object root
- **AND** rejects source mutation, changed tools, or mismatched dependency evidence

### Requirement: Retained packages preserve native import authority

The exported artifact MUST retain compiled application and Hex dependency bytes,
module inventory, native phase evidence, and attributable generated tests.
Library exports MUST implement the exact locked Elixir import surface and pass
native import observation plus separately authored independent acceptance.

#### Scenario: Consume a retained library

- **WHEN** a current consumer imports an admitted compiled Mix library
- **THEN** it uses the exact retained provider and dependency trees
- **AND** conflicting application names, versions, or bytes reject consumption
- **AND** source retirement does not prevent authorized execution or bounded evidence reopening
